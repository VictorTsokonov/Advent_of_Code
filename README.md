# Advent of Code Journey

## Why I Started Advent of Code

Advent of Code is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language. I started this journey to:

- Improve my problem-solving skills.
- Learn new programming concepts and languages.
- Join a community of coders who share the same passion for coding challenges.
- Enjoy the spirit of the holiday season through code!

## Purpose of Advent of Code

The purpose behind these challenges is multifaceted:

- **Skill Enhancement**: Each puzzle is designed to push my boundaries and make me think differently.
- **Learning Through Fun**: By weaving in the fun of holidays with coding, it makes learning a new skill or language much more enjoyable.
- **Community and Sharing**: It provides a platform to share solutions, learn from others, and even help those who might be stuck on a problem.

## Documentation Structure

- **Day-by-Day Progress**: For each day of the challenge, I'll document my thought process, my solution, and what I learned.
- **Reflections**: After completing the challenges, I'll reflect on my overall experience and the new skills I've acquired.

## Let's Connect

If you're on the same journey, or if you're curious about any of my solutions, feel free to reach out! I believe we can all grow through sharing knowledge and experiences.

Happy coding, and may your holidays be full of joy and meaningful code!
